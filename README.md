"[webpage to crawl] [depth] [target language] [translation boolean]"

[webpage to crawl] ... the url of the webpage you would like to crawl
[depth] ... the depth of the crawler
[target language] ... the target language tag (all supported language tags of the DeepL API i.e.: en-GB, de, hu, ...)
[translation boolean] ... enables translation if set to "true" otherwise it will be disabled
